This is an overlay tool that shows a dynamic display for multi-option Twitch channel points predictions!

It will automatically receive any prediction's options and betting activity in an animated overlay whenever you activate a new prediction on your stream.

The top channel-point-contributor on any particular outcome will have that display bar's background color become their chat color ( ;

It only appears on-screen for predictions with more than 2 options, currently (in order to play nicely with existing overlays)

Simply add it as a browser source by copying the URL after you connect your twitch account!

<ul>
<li>Once you connect your twitch account, the page will go blank (this is a success)</li>
<li>Test the browser source by starting a prediction with more than 2 options on your connected channel (it will pop up in the blank screen)</li>
<li>Copy the URL from that blank browser window and paste it into a new browser source in OBS/StreamLabs/etc.. Easy!</li>
</ul>

A 1920x1080 browser source works great. 1100px+ x 1100px+ width browser sources work best! The overlay will try to scale and adjust everything to fit it's given width but, at small sizes, depending on how much text is in each outcome, things can go squishh..

I am a humble artist/tech/streamer. if you would like to suggest edits, please do! If this tool has helped you along you way, I am very pleased (; this thing was hardd to build
